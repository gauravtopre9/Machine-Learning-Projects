### Data set Details 

What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

In this project I had created a WebApplication where you can choose the movie you recently watched and the application will return the similar one to movie that you watched.

#### Which Techniques I used in this project
1. Data Cleaning
2. ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE
3. Dataframe Merging 
4. Vectorizaton of string using CounterVectorizer
5. Built Model
6. Used Cosine Similarity
7. Used Pickle and Stramlit for WebApp
8. Used Heroku for WebApp deployment.
